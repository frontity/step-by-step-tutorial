# Contributing to Frontity

As you're already aware, Frontity is open source and freely available for everyone.

We believe that open source allows everyone to do things that they otherwise couldn't. Besides this, we think that collaboration leads to better development of technology.

There are many reasons to contribute to open source, one of which is that it will help make **you** a better developer. Check out our list of [good reasons to contribute](https://docs.frontity.org/contributing#why-to-contribute).

## How you can contribute

You can contribute in many ways:

- Contribute code to the Frontity framework
- Create themes/packages and share them on npm or GitHub
- Improve the docs (including this step-by-step tutorial! üòÑ )
- Help the community
- Spread the word

### üíª Contribute code

Frontity uses GitHub for managing the codebase. See the [main repo](https://github.com/frontity/frontity) if you want to actively test the codebase or go bug-hunting. If you find a bug in the course of your project development or in your use of Frontity you can [raise an issue](https://github.com/frontity/frontity/issues).

Please head over to this [Code Contribution guide](https://docs.frontity.org/contributing/code-contribution-guide) for more details of how you can contribute code to Frontity.

To keep up to date with developments in Frontity and to see what's currently in development or being planned see the [Feature Discussions](https://community.frontity.org/c/feature-discussions/33). Suggestions for new features, or your input on any of the discussions there, are always welcome.

### üé® Create themes and packages

Frontity is designed to be modular in that packages can add new functionality, in much the same way that plugins do in WordPress, and themes can add a new presentation layer.

You've seen during this step-by-step tutorial how a new theme can be built from scratch.

There is already a variety of themes and packages available on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=frontity). If you are creating your own theme or package you can upload it to _npmjs.com_ and make it available for the benefit of the whole Frontity development community. Plaudits and good karma will surely come your way! üßò

### üìñ Improve the documentation

The Frontity documentation is also hosted on GitHub in [this repo](https://github.com/frontity/docs), and this tutorial is in [this repo](https://github.com/frontity/step-by-step-tutorial).

If you spot any typos or errors, or have ideas for improving the docs please do raise an issue or a PR. Learn how you can contribute to the Frontity documentation [here](https://github.com/frontity/docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Help the community

As previously mentioned the Frontity community can be found at [community.frontity.org](https://community.frontity.org/). This is where you can ask questions and get solutions to your problems. It's also a great way to contribute, by helping others with their problems and sharing your knowledge for the benefit of others.

### üó£Ô∏è Spread the word

And finally, another great way that you can contribute is by spreading the word about Frontity, being an evangelist, and raising awareness of Frontity in other developer communities, such as the WordPress community or the JavaScript and React communities.

You can do this in several ways:

#### Tweeting

Tweet about things you've built or shared or written (see below) related to Frontity. You could even tweet about a Frontity related article you've read, or a new release or new feature. It all helps to spread the word about Frontity.

Be sure to mention [@frontity](https://twitter.com/Frontity) when tweeting.

#### Creating content

Share your knowledge by creating tutorials, case studies and videos that teach other developers about various aspects of working with Frontity. Remember to [share them](https://community.frontity.org/c/community/resources/15) in the community forum so that other users can know about them.


#### Speaking

Talk about Frontity, a particular technical aspect of working with Frontity, or even your own experience of working with Frontity such as a project you've built or a technical problem you've overcome. Tech conferences (such as [WordCamps](https://central.wordcamp.org/)) and local [MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/) groups are always looking for speakers to talk on interesting topics.

The [Events](https://community.frontity.org/c/community/events/50) category of the forum is a great place to let the community know about your talk or workshop.

#### Sharing your work

Have you built a project with Frontity? It could be a website for a client or just your personal site. Either way, swing by the [Showcase](https://community.frontity.org/c/community/showcases/19) category and tell the community more about it.

This is a great way to show what can be accomplished with the framework and to help inspire other developers with your work. Sometimes, an example is worth a thousand words!

## In conclusion

We look forward to your contributions, in whichever way you choose to contribute. For more information about ways to contribute see this [Contributing](https://docs.frontity.org/contributing) section of the docs.
