# Next Steps

Well done, you've completed the step-by-step tutorial and are well prepared to undertake a Frontity project for yourself.

But we're not about to leave you **by yourself**! We have plenty of resources and guidance at your disposal for when you need it during the development of your Frontity projects.

In this final section we'll introduce you to these.

We'll provide you with an overview of the documentation so you can find your way round.

In addition we'll tell you about our amazing community forum where you can ask for help, and help others too.

Frontity is open source and free, so we'll also tell you how you can give back by contributing both to the Frontity project and to the community.

And finally we'll let you know about our showcases section where you can get inspiration for your future projects. Who knows, maybe one of your projects built with Frontity will be featured there one day!

Here's a toast to congratulate you on the amazing progress you've made so far, and to wish you every success in your future endeavours with Frontity. Cheers! ü•Ç üçæ
