# Getting help and support

The documentation, as well as the other learning resources listed on the previous page, should be your first port of call when you need to check how something works, or when you get stuck.

If you can't find the answer to your problem in these resources then you can ask in the [**Frontity Community Forum**](https://community.frontity.org/). There you will find members of the community and fellow Frontity users who will be happy to help out and offer you support.

This is a forum that you can give back to. If you know the answer to someone else's question do please [help them out](https://community.frontity.org/c/dev-talk-questions/3) by sharing your knowledge. That, after all, is how communities get built - through mutual help and support.

The latest [releases](https://community.frontity.org/c/framework-development/releases/44) from Frontity can also be found in the community forum, as can the [discussions](https://community.frontity.org/c/feature-discussions/33) on upcoming features. So by visiting it regularly you'll be up to speed on all things Frontity.

Frontity is dedicated to a **positive community experience for everyone**. Please read through [this guide](https://community.frontity.org/t/frontity-community-forum-users-guide/4399) to learn more about the forum guidelines, how it is organized, and how to get the most out of it.

We look forward to welcoming you as a member of the Frontity community. See you there!
